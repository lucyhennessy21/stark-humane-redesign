        <h2>Educational Program</h2>
        <p>Our educational programs remain a top priority for the Stark County Humane Society. These programs contain
          age-appropriate instructions regarding responsible pet ownership. The programs include videos, discussions
          with the students and interaction with shelter animals that are transported to the schools by volunteers
          and/or staff. Through these educational efforts, it is our hope that these children will grow into responsible
          pet owners who love and care for their animals. We also welcome volunteer groups of students to help at the
          shelter.</p>

        <h2>Pet Therapy</h2>
        <p>As many of us know, animals offer companionship, comfort, and much joy. For nursing home residents and others
          with special needs, our pet therapy program provides the opportunity to enjoy friendly visits on a regular
          basis with a shelter volunteer or staff member and a puppy or kitten.</p>

        <h2>Cruelty Investigations</h2>
        <p>Our employees continue to respond to complaints regarding cruelty, abuse, or abandonment of animals
          throughout the county. The education of pet owners may be appropriate in some cases. However, our employees
          are trained in compiling evidence to successfully prosecute pet owners who violate the law. In 2023, a total
          of 555 complaints were investigated. Many of these complaints were due to pet owners moving and not taking
          their pets with them. We have had several calls from health departments and social services because an owner
          was not able to care for their animals or had many animals in their home. Ohio still is behind the rest of the
          country in updating cruelty laws. Many of our animal laws are over 150 years old, and desperately need to be
          revised. Our vehicles cover the entire county for cruelty investigations and pick up stray sick and/or injured
          animals. In 2022, we had a total of 577 day and night calls. In 2016, after years in the making Goddardâ€™s Law
          went into effect for the State of Ohio. It will now be a fifth-degree felony to knowingly cause serious
          physical harm to a companion animal. This includes depriving the pet of food, water or shelter or inflicting
          long-term pain.</p>
